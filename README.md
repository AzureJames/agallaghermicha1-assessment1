## Web Developers

This project uses Next.js 13 and React, combined with an API to fetch developers and put them into custom styled card components. These
components have three categories of devs, front end, full-stack, and back end.
The cards have hover states, conditional rendering of an up/down arrow, and UseState for expanding and contracting the randomly generated developer paragraph content.

## Theming

I used a technological, sci-fi type theme to bring the web developer subject matter to the forefront. 
The project also makes heavy use of neumorphism.
